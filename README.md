# Company-Webpage

My first published project using CSS and HTML. 
Created to consolidate my learning with these two languages. 
The website is just a spoof, with no real purpose but to experiment with what I have learnt and was trying out.
Any feedback is appreciated :)

P.S. First use of github and git using Visual Studio Code
